The easiest and quickest way to accept Bitcoin and Altcoin payments, and receive payouts in Euros or U.S. Dollars without any risk! Made by Hanzo.com

== Description ==

= Hanzo Bitcoin Payment Gateway for WooCommerce =

Using our **fully automated cryptocurrency processing platform and invoice system**, online businesses can **accept Bitcoin** as well as other digital currencies (Altcoins) hassle-free. Payments received from customers can be instantly converted to Fiat, and you can receive **payouts in Euros and U.S. Dollars** directly to your bank account or PayPal. Alternatively, store owners can choose to receive **payouts in Bitcoin - no verification** procedures necessary.

== Start Accepting Bitcoin in Minutes! ==

The extension allows stores that use Wordpress WooCommerce shopping cart system to accept Bitcoin payments as well as Altcoins via the Hanzo API. Integration and configuration of our WooCommerce module is very straightforward, and the payment gateway is fully automated - you will receive automatic payment confirmations and order status updates. To find out more about the benefits of Bitcoin for your business, as well as the solution offered by Hanzo, [*check our website*](https://hanzo.io/accept-bitcoin).

= Features =

* The gateway is fully automatic - set it and forget it.
* Payment amount is calculated using real-time exchange rates.
* Your customers can select to pay with Bitcoin and 40+ other cryptocurrencies at checkout, while your payouts are in a single currency of your choice.
* [Sandbox environment](https://sandbox.hanzo.io) for testing with Tesnet Bitcoin.
* No setup or recurring fees.
* No chargebacks - guaranteed!

= Functionality =

* Extend your invoice expiration time (if payouts are in BTC).
* Accept slight underpayments automatically.
* Refunds can be issued directly from the invoice - without involvement of the seller.

= How it works - example =

1. An item in the store costs 20 euro.
2. A customer wants to buy the item and selects to pay with Bitcoin.
3. An invoice is generated and, according to the current exchange rate, the price is 2000 euro per bitcoin, so the customer has to pay 0.01 bitcoins.
4. Once the invoice is paid, the merchant gets a notification and is credited 19.80 euro (20 euro minus our 1% flat fee), or 0.0099 BTC.
